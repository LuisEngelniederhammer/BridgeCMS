# BridgeCMS #

BridgeCMS is aiming to be a simple, lightweight and absolutely free Content Management System with similar high standards and functionallity to boards or software you would normally be charged hundreds of dollars for.
Including a completely customizable permission, user, page, style and mod system.

The mod system or mod manager is just a simple tool that will give developers the ability to use functions from The BridgeCMS to create their own small plugins to full scale new software within the CMS.
